Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 2 hours / session

Course Description
------------------

This class presents a detailed study of soil properties with emphasis on interpretation of field and laboratory test data and their use in soft-ground construction engineering. Topics to be covered include: consolidation and secondary compression; basic strength principles; stress-strain strength behavior of clays, emphasizing effects of sample disturbance, anisotropy, and strain rate; strength and compression of granular soils; and engineering properties of compacted soils. Some knowledge of field and laboratory testing is assumed for all students. 1.37 is desirable, and 1.361 is a prerequisite.

Conduct of Subjects
-------------------

*   Classes run as combination of regular lectures and class discussions.
*   Reading assignments include class notes and papers.
*   **Do not** consult any prior homework problems or exams.
*   Homework problems, class problems, and class discussion count 30%.
*   One 2-hour mid-term exam counts 30%.
*   One three-hour final exam counts 40%.

_Advantages  
_  
Well defined boundary conditions → well defined soil properties via interpretation with continuum mechanics.  
  
Can control loading and drainage conditions → property variation with stress path and drainage.  
  
Known soil type and features.


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
_Advantages_  
  
Testing soil at in situ conditions and usually less affected by disturbance.  
  
Usually lower cost, more rapid and some field tests (CPTU) can provide continuous profile.  
  
Best suited for spatial variability → mean trends + scatter about mean.

_Limitations  
  
_Sample disturbance  
  
\- Affects properties (especially cohesionless soils)  
\- Misleading spatial variations.  
  
Discontinuous data on small fraction of soil  
  
High cost

_Limitations  
  
_Ill-defined boundary conditions (stress-strain-drainage)  
  
\- Need empirical correlations for soil properties  
  
May not know soil type
